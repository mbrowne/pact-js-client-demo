Demo of how one might use [pact-js-mocha](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-mocha) in an app
(using a hello-world React app as an example).

Note: This demo is only a client-side app, so it only tests the consumer, not the provider.
But the generated PACT files could be used to test a provider implementation.
